# Distance-measurement
My project work as a part of course Microcontroller Programming.

The project is based on ATMega328P, programmed through C++ using ATMEL Studio 7 and used AVRDUDESS as a compiler and programmer interface. The basic idea is to measure a water level inside the container with an ultrasonic sensor placed on top of the conainer and display the result on LCD.
